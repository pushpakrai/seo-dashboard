This project is a simple, modular Python-based dashboard designed for quick prototyping and learning. It leverages Python libraries to deliver structured and reusable code.

## Project Structure

```

├── .devcontainer/         # Dev container setup for consistent development environment
├── .git/                  # Git repository for version control
├── pages/                 # Directory for modular page components
├── __init__.py            # Initializes the package
├── Hello.py               # Core script containing the main functionality

```

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Organizes code into reusable components for better maintainability.
- **Streamlined Setup**: Includes `requirements.txt` for dependency management.
- **Flexible Development Environment**: Preconfigured `.devcontainer` for consistent development across systems.
- **Utility Scripts**: Prebuilt functions in `utils.py` to simplify repetitive tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Dev Containers**: For a consistent coding environment.
- **Git**: Version control for collaboration and version tracking.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-dashboard.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd python-dashboard
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python Hello.py
   ```
2. Modify components in the `pages/` folder to extend functionality.
3. Add utility functions in `utils.py` for custom needs.
